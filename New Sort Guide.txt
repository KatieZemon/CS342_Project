To Create A new Sort:

Create a class with the name of the sort similar to one already made.
Make sure to check the class variable "running". If it is false, the sort should stop.
Use the class variable "delay" for the delay.
The array "bars" is what is being sorted


In Demo.java's actionPerformed(), add the item as the other sorts are added.

In MainDisplay.java, add an else if section to updateSorts() for that sort class
