To Create A new Sort:

Create a class with the name of the sort similar to one already made.
Make sure to check the class variable "running". If it is false, the sort should stop.
Use the class variable "delayTime" for the delayTime.
The array "bars" is what is being sorted.
SelectedBar is the name of the variable which holds the index of the highlighted bar


In Demo.java's actionPerformed(), add the item as the other sorts are added.

In MainDisplay.java, add an else if section to updateSorts() for that sort class
